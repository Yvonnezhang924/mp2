I just give one prompt and it shows the basic page that I want. LLM is smart 
Prompt as follows:
Ok great! My task is to create a single-page react app.
The requirements are as follows:
Your app should have the following features:

A list view: where users can input a query into a search bar and the app returns a list of results that match the query (i.e. searching movies or pokemon). There should also be a way to sort the search results based on different properties of the results (such as the name or rank) and of specifying an ordering (ascending and descending). Also, the search bar should filter as you type. You can sort and filter in the client side.
A gallery view: that displays some kind of image media from the chosen API (gallery of movie posters). The gallery view should also have some kind filtering attribute where users can select one or many attributes and filter the gallery by them (i.e. genres of films or music).
A detail view: When an item in the search view or the gallery view is clicked, the app should display the different attributes of the selected item. Also, this view should have previous and next buttons (can be implemented with arrows) that lets the user cycle through the list of objects. A detail view should have a specific route when navigated to. Basically, a user should be able to access the detail route through a specific url.
Our app should let users interact with the data from the pokemon api @https://pokeapi.co/
